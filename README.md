# My Favorite Movie: Spider-Man 🕷️

**Title:** Spider-Man  
**Why it's my favorite:** *It balances heart, humor, and action while showing how an ordinary person grows into a hero.*

---

## Quick Synopsis
Peter Parker, an ordinary teenager, gains spider-like abilities after a scientific accident. He struggles to balance school, responsibility, and his identity while protecting New York City from dangerous foes.

---

## Favorite Characters
- **Peter Parker / Spider-Man** — relatable, clever, and human.
- **Aunt May** — the emotional backbone and moral compass.
- **Mary Jane / Gwen Stacy** — love interest and emotional anchor.
- **The Villain (e.g., Green Goblin / Doc Ock / Vulture)** — compelling because their motivations often mirror Peter’s own struggles.

---

## Favorite Scenes
1. Peter learning to use his powers (fun and awkward).
2. The big rooftop or bridge battle — high stakes and great visuals.
3. Quiet moments with Aunt May — they remind us why he fights.

---

## Themes & Why It Resonates
- **Responsibility:** “With great power comes great responsibility” — a core moral.
- **Coming-of-age:** Balancing personal life and duty.
- **Sacrifice:** True heroism often requires personal cost.

---

## Soundtrack & Visuals
The music heightens emotional beats and action scenes. The visual style (swinging through the city, choreographed fight sequences) makes Spider-Man feel dynamic and cinematic.

---

## Recommended Watch Order / Versions
- Original 2002 *Spider-Man* (directed by Sam Raimi) — classic origin.
- The Amazing Spider-Man series — different take on the story.
- MCU Spider-Man (*Homecoming*, *Far From Home*, *No Way Home*) — modern, connected to a larger universe.
*(Pick whichever version you love most — they all bring something different.)*
